I am a recent graduate, earning a Bachelor of Science degree with a focus on software development. I also have a degree in fine art. My education combined with experience in management and customer service give me an excellent foundation to launch my new career in software or web development.

I love to design and create new things.  Finding innovative solutions to problems drives me, whether I am building something with my hands or solving a challenge in software development.  I have a passion for learning and really enjoy working alone and in team environments. 

My desire and determination to learn helped me to earn a 4.0 gpa upon graduation.  I have continued to challenge myself to code on my own time.  I believe that mindfulness and balance are key in both work and home life.  I have 3 amazing kids, love to make art, garden, read, travel and spend time outdoors.

I am currently seeking employment as an entry level software or web developer.  I canâ€™t wait to start my new career, put my skills to work and to continue learning and growing in the industry.
